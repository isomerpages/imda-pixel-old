ARVR is a technology that is not yet foundational to the success of every product, service, or initiative. In this workshop, we will get inspired to connect the dots between technology and what it means to the customers and businesses. It can be used to transform your team’s strategic objectives into practical implementation strategies via the tried-and-tested methods of design thinking.
