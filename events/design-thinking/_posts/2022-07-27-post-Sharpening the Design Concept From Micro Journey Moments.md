### About the workshop 

Empathy is the first step in design thinking because it is a skill that allows us to understand and share the same feelings that others feel. Through empathy, we can put ourselves in other people's shoes and connect with how they might think about their problem, circumstance, or situation.

In this workshop, you will learn how to Identify the critical personas to your business which is essential to crafting the problem statement you seek to solve. You also will learn to recognise the steps taken to determine how you can go about the micro-moments to sharpen your design concept.
